# GREENLAB_Datathon_22_UPV

Shiny Dashboard of Andalucía (Spain). Created in april 2022 for the competition Datathon 22 - RETOS EN UN MUNDO CAMBIANTE - of Universidad Politécnica de Valencia.

The dashboard is based on analysis of socio-economic and environmental vulnerability indicators of Andalusian municipalities using R's data analisys libraries and Shinydashboard library for data visualization.

The goal of this project is to provide a classification map of the municipalities that compose the Andalusian Autonomous Community according to vulnerability from a perspective compatible with the 2030 Agenda of UN's SDGs.
